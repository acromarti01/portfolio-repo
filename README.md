Portfolio Project

## Description

- What was your motivation?

    My motivation for tackling the project was to learn how to use flex boxes and css grid to make a presentable portfolio.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")

    I built the project to further develop my skills with flex boxes and css grid and to use my profolio to present my coding projects to future employers. 

- What problem does it solve?

    Flex boxes helps with wrapping elements to the next line to allow the user to change the window screen size and still view the accesible content. It also allows the content in to be viewable on ipads and mobile phones

- What did you learn?

    I learned different ways to apply flex boxes and css grid to place to stack content if need be on mobile devides and smaller screens.
